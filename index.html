      <p>My name is Isaac Fiuza. I was born in California and grew up in Brazil until I was 14 when I came back to the
        U.S
        in 2001.
        I graduated from SLCC in 2016 with an associates in C.S with two cerificates, one in software development and
        another in Computer Essentials. I decided to do this bootcamp to learn more and get all the skills I need to
        become a Web Developer.</p>
